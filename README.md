# Movie-Recommendation-System

The Movie Recommendation website suggests movies which the users may like, based on the movies that they have previously watched. Every logged in user should have access to the recommendation system. The system will go through the movies that user has previously watched to and rated, then according to that information it should suggest movies to the user. The project's main aim is to provide accurate movie recommendations to the user.
